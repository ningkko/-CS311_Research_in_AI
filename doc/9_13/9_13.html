        1. Evolution itself is the designer.</br>
        2. Random(Programs) -> Assessment -> Solution(Programs)</br>
        3. AI is developed for solving problems that humans don't know how to solve.</br>

        1. What is AI: When building a bridge, a person knows what to use for building the bridge but don’t know the exact way to build it. AI would take the ingredients the person gives it and ‘evolve’ bridges according to the math model/algorithms the person provides. Infinitely many bridges will be build and the person would decide which are good bridges. There's also chance that the algorithm does not work, there might be no satisfying bridges  built.</br>
        2. Computers control interfaces.

    <p class="meeting">
        (Cluster meeting 1: with Andrew David.  September 11th, 17-18pm @Dobra Tea)</br>
            
        1. Andrew: Since AI has all these possibilities of going off control, then just let it lose control. Build a model to predict which cities are going to die.</br>
        2. David made an online poker AI to play poker with human players (find a poker game model and develop an AI model to plugin) in high school. </br>"Within five to ten year there won't be anyone playing poker game online. There will only be a group of AIs playing with each other and the ones developed earlier might always win cuz they have many years of training experience."</br>
        3. AI in games/VR</br>
        Generate new worlds.

    <p class="question">
        *What’s the difference between machine learning/pure pattern recognition and AI? 
        AI might contain a part of machine learning and both of them need pattern recognition as a basic function?
