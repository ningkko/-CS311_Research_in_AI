Some Notes on the class Sep 25th:</br>

-> Modules:</br>
Modules in biosphere: semi-auto entities; hierarchy required.</br>
Modules in programming: a part o solution, eg. operating system(human defined). </br></br>
Requirement: Theres a clear beginning and ending.</br>
</br></br>
Under certain conditions, modules are directly correlated with fitness.</br>
Why modules?</br>
1.Modular softwares easier to read, recombine w/o interrupting other part of the program; 2.Reuse; 3.GP.
</br>
Template, can edit and use in genetic programming. ADFs//auto defined functions
drawbacks: number/parameters have to be predefined//Koza
</br>
</br></br></br>
-> PushGP tag-based 
A number of instructions are stored and can be retrieved later.</br>
Result: Useful only for a small number of programs. Evolution in the sort term does poorly on modularity. The probably reason: modularity does not contain a smooth gradient.
</br>
</br>
-> Auto-construction</br>
AutoDoG solved some problems and intrigues more questions about the genetic programming.<a>(??)</a>

</br>Different ways of genetic programming algorithms: Mutation, crossover and select & survive.</br>


The flying agent behavior: each agent has a push program inside and every time they run the program and choose their behavior. Auto construction.</br></br>
//Are there creatures reproducing by mutations<a>(??)</a></br>
Ingredients of reproduction<a>(??)</a>

</br>**Evolutionary history of creatures on earth<a>(??)</a>
</br></br></br>
-> Notes on the Flying Agents paper: </br>
<a href="https://github.com/ningkko/CS311_Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/past/progress/contents/9_26/FlyingAgents.pdf">Scanned paper with notes</a>.</br>
-> Why need the acceleration upper bound<a>(??)</a></br>
-> SWARMEVOLVE1.0. Each agent has its constant set. Mutation happens through constant changes. </br>Agent states considered from: </br>1. the “crowding” radius; </br>2. the center of the world;</br> 3. neighbors’ velocity; </br>4. gravity of all agents; </br>5. random vector;</br>6. neighbors of other species that are within a “crowding” radius;</br>7. goal orientation//energy source.</br>
-> SWARMEVOLVE2.0, driven force refined, reproduction way refined, added individual growth (what's the use<a>(??)</a>) Color:Friend/Other</br>
-> Color: What's the difference except for the color? Why introduce color other than monitoring? When do agents change color?</br>
-> Cluster Meeting:</br>
We did the meeting on Messenger and GoogleDoc. Since projects haven't started yet, it seems that we don't have much to talk about.<a href="https://github.com/ningkko/CS311_Portfolio/blob/gh-pages/past/progress/contents/9_26/cluster.md">a full documentation</a></p>
