    Status Report:
        </br><p class="content">

    2 project concepts, one about artificial world settings, the other about artificial life.</br>
    Some other paper about genetic programming and autoconstruction.

    Progress Report:
        </br><p class="content">
            1. Use probably genetic programming and autoconstruction to build an AI program which constructs artificial  worlds with alternative physical laws and virtual reality environments. To be detailed, the program takes different arrangements of artificial world environments as inputs and generate new object arrangements. </br>
    *What should be the inputs for creating new physics laws? </br></br>
    2. The program takes attributes of existing animals including appearances, metal states, movement compositions(mechanics), habits, roles in the biosphere and etc. as inputs and generate new life forms.
    It would be great if we could make this program a future-fish-predictor.</br> </br> 

    *What is the most difficult question that could be solved by AI tech?
