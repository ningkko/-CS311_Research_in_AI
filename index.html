    Progress Report:</br>
      <p class="content">

         -> -> Cluster meeting w/ David Jona Per, Nov 1st, classroom.
            </br> Talked about progresses.
            </br> Per has been implementing A* in the game. Jona is doing somthing with TensorFlow, David had been sick for the last two weeks and so didn't make much progress. I have been looking at clojure code repeatedly trying to remeber..? 
            </br></br>
        -> Research group meeting, Nov 1st, classroom.
            </br> Talked about what to do before next Tuesday.
            </br> Find dataset with more variables
            </br> Propel
        </br> </br> 
       -> Research group meeting, Nov 5th, GoogleHangout.
            </br> Talked again about the cancer prediction paper.
            </br> Ian pointed out that I should think more carefully and actually design fitness functions for GPs (after looking at my sqrt(sum(x^2-y^2)) error function)..
            </br> Ian explained and ran his propel code of finding abs value. It did not find the target function.. Maybe the fitness function is bad? The error keeps around 17..
            </br> Ian walked through how to use propel.
            </br> after changing datasets for about a month it seems we come back with the Astronomical one.. 
            </br> A target before Ian come out with a prototype of the project(..?) => write a GP with propel with self-designed mutation, crossover and fitness functions to solve the function (+ (Math/pow x 3) (* x 3))
