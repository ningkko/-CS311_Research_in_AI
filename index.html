    Progress Report:</br>
      <p class="content">

         -> Cluster meeting w/ David Jona Per, Nov 1st, classroom.
            </br> Talked about progresses.
            </br> Per has been implementing A* in the game. Jona is doing something with TensorFlow, David had been sick for the last two weeks and so didn't make much progress. I have been looking at clojure code repeatedly trying to remember..? 
            </br></br>
        -> Research group meeting, Nov 1st, classroom.
            </br> 1. Talked about what to do before next Tuesday.
            </br> 2. Find dataset with more variables
            </br> 3. Propel
        </br> </br> 
       -> Research group meeting, Nov 5th, GoogleHangout.
            </br> 1. Talked again about the cancer prediction paper.
            </br> 2. Ian pointed out that I should think more carefully and actually design fitness functions for GPs (after looking at my sqrt(sum(x^2-y^2)) error function)..
            </br> 3. Ian explained and ran his propel code of finding abs value. It did not find the target function.. Maybe the fitness function is bad? The error keeps around 17..
            </br> 4. Ian walked through how to use propel.
            </br> after changing datasets for about a month it seems we come back with the Astronomical one.. 
            </br> 5. A target before Ian come out with a prototype of the project(..?) => write a GP with propel with self-designed mutation, crossover and fitness functions to solve the function (+ (Math/pow x 3) (* x 3))

        </br> </br> 
        -> A brief conclusion of what I have been doing since October 16th:
            </br>In the first two weeks I was learning clojure.</br>1. The first week I read the book A Quick Introduction to Clojure, and went through the tutorial on <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/clojure/">Learn Clojure in Y minutes</a>.
            </br> We were also trying to find a possible dataset to use.. 
            </br>2. The second week, I did excercises on <a href="https://github.com/lspector/Clojestions">Clojestions</a> (<a href="https://github.com/ningkko/Recycle/blob/master/clojure/Clojestion.clj">practice code)</a> and went through <a href="https://github.com/lspector/clojinc">Clojinc</a>. 
                </br>In the third week, I started looking at <a href="https://github.com/lspector/gp">Lee's GP examples</a>. And then I have been trying to rewwrite <a href"https://github.com/ningkko/GP">a GP to find absolute values</a>. ->> I used a wrong error function first so it always output the input itself. Then I revised several things, and the code scale runs too large to executed after 4 generations. And then I revised it again. Now it runs into infinite loop after the firtt generation..
            </br>Then before yesterday I was trying to revise the GP part of Propel (trying to find an abs-func GP. It didn't work. Yesterday Ian showed his code of evovling the absolute value using Propel.
            </br> In the following week I'll continue revising the GP code, try to find a fitness function for the propel abs program. Probably -> Get hands on the actual data..
