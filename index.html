    Progress Report:</br>

            <p class="content">

                What I was doing: reading about Clojure&Kaggle</br></br>
Cluster meeting Thu October 11</br>
Talked about the way to contact each group member and Ian helped Elijah installing Clojure</br>

Cluster meeting Mon October 15th</br>
Talked about how to use Gozzlia and also Find other 2 data set on Kaggle that we might be using</br>
                
Cluster meeting Tue October 16th</br>
Solving jdk problems </br>
Ian showed how some clojure codes</br>
In the following 2 weeks Elijah&Ning -> learn clojure</br>



Progress
   
-> QuickClojure</br>
-> clojure writing style</br>

API=the interface for two programs to talk together</br>
Lisp is both a programming language (originally designed in 1958) and also a recognised structural basis for a collection of programming languages (Common Lisp, Scheme and Clojure being a few popular examples of languages that are built upon the same syntax as Lisp). </br>

Clojure uses Java classes</br>
</br>

List: '(1 2 3)</br>
Vector: [1 2 3]</br>
Map: {:foo “bar”}</br>
Set: #{1 2 3}</br>


Lexicase Selection </br>
uncompromising problems</br>

pareto front selection</br>
no mediocrity. Agents behaving the best at something and (might be) bad at other things will selected.</br>

How the mentioned problem works;</br>
Find what combinations that make he boolean constraint return true. 3SAT</br>

//Things are related but don’t know how they’re related.
