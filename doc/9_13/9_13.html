        1. Evolution itself is the designer.</br>
        2. Random(Programs) -> Assessment -> Solution(Programs)</br>
        3. AI is developed for solving problems that humans don't know how to solve.</br>

        What is AI: When building a bridge, a person knows what to use for building the bridge but don’t know the exact way to build it. AI would take the ingredients the person gives it and ‘evolve’ bridges according to the math model/algorithms the person provides. Infinitely many bridges will be build and the person would decide which are good bridges. There's also chance that the algorithm does not work, there might be no satisfying bridges  built.

    <p class="question">
        *What’s the difference btween machine learning/pure pattern recognition programs and AI? 
        AI might contain a part of machine learning and both of them need pattern recognizing as a basic function?
