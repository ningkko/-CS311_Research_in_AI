        -> Push: </br>
        1.Has stacks for each data type. Instructions go to the corresponding stack from the top. If nothing corresponding in the stack->skip.</br>
        2.General software synthesis & quantum computer algorithms.</br>
        3.Subprograms in other languages.</br></br>
        -> UMAD: </br>
        1.Add gene before/after with probabilities.</br> -> (new/pld)Gene index mixed.
        Delete randomly -> old not necessarily replaced by new ones.</br>
        "Dissociate addition from deletion."</br>
        2.Newly generally genes are affected more by parent programs.</br></br>
        *Other genetic operators: Uniform mutation(similar to UMAD but gene index does not change), alteration, uniform close mutation, crossover, half-addtion-half-deletion.</br></br>
        4.Parameters: addition rate & deletion rate. deletionRate=aR/(1+aR)</br>
        5.With high rates, UMAD does worse in Syllables and X-Word Lines problems. With low rate UMAD does worse in Vector Average and Sum of Squares problems.</br>
        6.Population: Generally larger the population larger the success rate.</br>
        7.Genome: if genomes of the same size dominate parent selections over a few generations, genomes of that size may make up the entire population in a generation. -> Every single new child will also be that size -> horizontal lines in the plot."
        </br>
        8.UMAD => crossover not essential.

    <p class="class">
        1.Symbolic regression</br>
        </br>
        2.Number of paths to get a wanted gene using UMAD is exponential to using replacement.
        </br>e.g.To get ADC from ABC in two steps, replacement has only got 2 ways., UMAD has 15 ways.</br>
        3.Evolution itself does evolve during time.
        Crossover: It's like more artificial than real evolution. There is the thinking the crossover is the key to evolutionary programming since it can just combine good parents together ot get to wanted child in one step. But there might be a really better way involving crossover.</br>
        4.Problems never solved: Maybe there's no enough information for the system to know to generate the right answer. 
    </p>
    <p class="question">
        -> Quantum computers?</br>
        -> Reproducing ways are contributes of program objects, with evolution the way would change and so computer can create new ways of creating virtual real worlds.
