If want a machine to complete a task-> searchWhich choices to make, when and how to choose.

SEARCH1.Search through a fixed length list(def space [;; a vector])(defn true-condition something [args])(filter true-condition space);; lazy sequence -> sequential collection which is not necessarily evaluated. Could becasted to other sequence classes.;; realized in 32bit chunks2. Use loop and recur to loop thru the given list and so try to find the target element;; map has loop written in it. Usually in clojure don¡¯t use recur;; clojure has recur because everything is immutable.replace the true-condition function. E.g. even? odd?3.Instead of using absingle linear list, use a branching one.;; more subsets[1 [3 5 7 8] [[1 2 [3 4] 5] 6 7 [8 9]] 10]DFS:if subsequential, pull elements out, concat with the rest of the list->make it thefirst thing to searchBFS:concat at the end of the list. -> Search subsets after searching all elements atthe same level./* conventional search algorithms: DFS and BFS ;;exhaustive.* AI search algs should not be exhaustive and should make better choices rather thanchecking everything.* A question of which element to look at first.*/4. Keep track of the history.Use a hashmap to keep record of the history(hash-map :contents :history);; and take the history of the current content, then add the new content on the history5. Add frontier and generator¡­successor generatorA*

Manhattan Distance: the distance between two points measured along axes at right anglesAdmissible heuristics: a heuristic function is said to be admissible if it never overestimates the cost of reaching the goal, i.e. the cost
it estimates to reach the goal is not higher than the lowest possible cost from the current point in the path.
